## 2024-09-05 - ADB Backup Flag Intentionally Enabled
**Vulnerability:** The application was configured with `android:allowBackup="true"`, permitting unencrypted data extraction via ADB, which lowers the bar for data exfiltration.
**Learning:** This configuration was reportedly intentional, likely for debugging convenience. While an attacker with physical access might have other ways to access data (e.g., with root access), leaving backups enabled provides a trivial, non-invasive method for extracting sensitive data like browsing history without needing to root the device. This violates the principle of defense-in-depth.
**Prevention:** Security best practices must be enforced to create layered defenses. Disabling backups (`android:allowBackup="false"`) forces an attacker to use more sophisticated and privileged methods to access application data, significantly increasing the effort required. Risky debugging features should be strictly limited to debug builds. Sentinel has enforced this secure default to harden the application against low-effort data theft.
